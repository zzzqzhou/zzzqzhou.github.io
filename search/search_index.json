I received my B.Eng. degree in computer science in June 2020 from Nanjing Normal University, fortunately working with Prof. Wanqi Yang.</p> <p>Currently, I am broadly interested in domain generalization and its application in semantic segmentation and medical image analysis. I am also focusing on multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning and other related topics in computer vision and machine learning.</p>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":"<ul> <li><code>2020/09-Present</code> Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, M.S.</li> <li><code>2016/09-2020/06</code> School of Computer and Electronic Information, Nanjing Normal University, B.Eng.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#working-experience","title":"Working Experience","text":"<ul> <li><code>2022/06-2022/11</code>  Research Intern at SenseTime, supervised by Wei Li.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>\"*\" indicates the equal contribution</p> <ul> <li> <p>Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation via Random Amplitude Mixup and Domain-Specific Image Restoration.
